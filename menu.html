            <p class="card-text">
              You love to cook, but you hate, hate, hate one of the biggest
              consequences of cooking: the dishes. You'll let that pile of
              dirties get to the heights of the tower of Babel. With this meal,
              you can save the seared, water-logged hands for another day. All
              you need is a pot, a pan, and a colander, and your taste buds to
              savor teriyaki sauce, with a hint of heat, coating tender steak
              strips and fresh broccoli. Chores can wait until you're done
              eating… okay, until tomorrow morning… maybe the evening after
              next. Tip: Make quick work of mincing garlic by smashing the whole
              clove with the side of your chef's knife. Then rock the knife back
              and forth, keeping the tip steady by resting your other hand over
              the top.

            <p class="card-text">
              Culinary pop quiz: “Florentine” means: a) pertaining to the city
              of Florence, Italy b) a long preparation of a sauce, using at
              least twenty ingredients, three pans, an hour or so of time, and a
              ton of patience, or c) a dish with spinach in it. Ding ding ding,
              C is the correct answer. (You'll also get credit for A.) If you
              missed it, just order this meal and lap up the creamy spinach
              sauce… you'll do better next time.

              You've had every burger combination imaginable, even the ones from
              imaginary burger joints in cartoons. But not this one: roasted red
              tomatoes and salty prosciutto sit atop a perfect meat patty,
              making each bite both juicy and crunchy, and just right. A new
              burger now sits atop the list.

              (huh?) with this delicious chicken and goat cheese combination,
              every bite bathing in that creamy tang of goat cheese. There are
              biscuits and butternut squash as well, and while there are no
              goat-related idioms for those, they are the most important things
              to a Meal Master meal: easy to make and delicious.

              A warm bowl of pasta on a cold night; is there anything better?
              Answer: A million dollars, a basket of puppies, a bright rainbow,
              a gentle ocean breeze, a walk in the park, your favorite team
              winning, your favorite team winning the (insert the biggest game
              here), your children being born, weddings, Christmas trees,
              kittens tangled in string, flowers, two million dollars… ok, ok,
              ok. How about two bowls of pasta on a cold night, which this meal
              provides? We'll take it. Tip: Make quick work of mincing garlic by
              smashing the whole clove with the side of your chef's knife. Then
              rock the knife back and forth, keeping the tip steady by resting

              of paprika (the smoky!) on the pork, a bit of jalapeño ranch from
              the slaw, and fresh pico combine for handheld dinner delight. This
              meal is smokin'!
